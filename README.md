# Social Media Database Project

Project Overview

In this project, I am designing a foundational structure for a social media database that seamlessly integrates with a frontend interface. The database is designed to manage a variety of user data and interactions, including:

User Information: Basic data about users and their profiles.
Followers and Following: Relationships between users, capturing who follows whom.
Interests: Information about user interests and preferences.
Public Activity: Data on user engagement with posts, including:
Post Likes: Tracking which users like which posts.
Comments: Storing user comments on posts.
Comment Likes: Tracking likes on individual comments.
Hashtags: Managing hashtags that users follow and use.
Bookmarks: Allowing users to bookmark posts.

It demonstrates the clear connections and interactions between various social media activities. My approach aims to provide a straightforward and accurate representation of  relationships within a social media platform, ensuring an effective integration with the frontend.
